# Trivy Ignore File for AzureDevopsApi
# This file allows you to ignore specific vulnerabilities found by Trivy
# Format: [package-type:]package-name[:version][:ecosystem] [vulnerability-id]
#
# Note: This file is optional. To use it, you may need to run Trivy locally or modify the workflow.
# The current GitHub Action workflow does not support ignore files directly.
#
# Examples:
# - Ignore specific vulnerability: CVE-2021-44228
# - Ignore package: alpine:3.15
# - Ignore by ecosystem: npm:axios:1.6.0
#
# IMPORTANT: Only ignore vulnerabilities after careful consideration and risk assessment.
# Document the reason for ignoring in comments.

# Example ignore rules (uncomment and modify as needed):

# Ignore specific vulnerability in a package
# npm:axios CVE-2021-12345

# Ignore all vulnerabilities in a specific package version
# golang:github.com/example/package:1.2.3

# Ignore vulnerabilities in development dependencies (if applicable)
# dev:npm:webpack-dev-server

# Common reasons for ignoring:
# 1. False positive - vulnerability doesn't affect your usage
# 2. Not applicable - vulnerability is in unused code paths
# 3. Risk accepted - vulnerability risk is acceptable for your use case
# 4. Fixed in your environment - vulnerability patched at infrastructure level
